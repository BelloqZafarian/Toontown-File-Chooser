This tool is an adaptation of Geri Winter's "Sample Basic File Browser", a python script that creates an interface in Panda3D which allows you to browse for a file.
This tool has been adapted for Toontown, and has also received some upgrades. Those include:

- Allowing the user to fall back to their drives, rather than being limited on the drive they're currently running the game from
- Shortening the names of directories and files if they're too long
- Scrolling the file name input if it's too long
- Allowing the user to open a file path, rather than just a file
- Small interface improvements.

You may use this script in any project you'd like.

Happy coding!
